# ParkNomad
The perfect app for gym enthusiast!

# Description
There area several problematic factors that prevent an individual from practicing a healthy lifestyle such as an expensive gym meberships/contract, scheduling, traveling, or even an uncomfortable feeling from being in an enclosed facility. This app allows the gym enthusiasts to conveniently locate outdoor gyms near the input location using their mobile device, tablet, or PC. With the use of google maps API, an interactive map is displayed allowing the user to see the park's name, address, rating, and image. Simultaneously, using the OpenWeatherMap API, the weather for the user's current date is displayed. In addition to displaying nearby locations with an interactive map and weather forecast, the user also has the option to input a radius and hours of operation parameter to further filter out their search result. Lastly, the user is given the opportunity to create a new search and load up a different map of a different location. 

## How to Use
Once the page is loaded up, the user is prompted to type a city location, radius, and hours of operation of their choosing. Then the user may simply read and analyze their generated map. If the user chooses to search a different location, they would simply click the back button to navigate towards the search page again.
